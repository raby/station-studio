# station-studio — convenience entry points for the test matrix.
#
# Three layers, each independently runnable:
#   make test-backend       pytest + coverage gate (Python)
#   make test-frontend-unit vitest (api.ts + component tests)
#   make test-e2e           playwright (UI ↔ API roundtrip)
#
# `make test` runs all three in order; CI does the same.

# Backend: pytest + fail-under so coverage can't silently drop. Threshold
# is intentionally loose — engine/api are ~100%, but bootstrap_classics
# (66%) and seed_stations (69%) are CLI entry-points whose argparse +
# print branches don't test cleanly. With those bringing the aggregate
# down, 90% leaves real headroom; the gate fires on a *regression*, not
# on the resting state. Per-file enforcement happens at the Vitest layer.
test-backend:
	$(PY) -m coverage run -m pytest
	$(PY) -m coverage report --fail-under=90

# Frontend: vitest with --coverage so the per-file lines threshold + aggregate
# statements/functions/branches thresholds in vite.config.js fire. Without
# --coverage vitest skips the report and the gate never runs.
